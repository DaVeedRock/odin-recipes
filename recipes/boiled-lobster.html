        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Boiled lobster is a comfort food in my family that is typically served plain with a melted butter dipping sauce as a side dish.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1-2 pound lobster</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot about halfway full with water. Cover the pot, and bring the water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once the water has reached a boil, place lobster into pot. Cover, set medium heat and let steam for approximately 5 minutes,
                or until the lobster turns bright red and the tail is firm and opaque when checked.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the lobster from the pot and serve with melted butter.</li>
            

        </ol>
